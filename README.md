 # winsdar

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app, and sanity.io.

Technologies used:
- Advanced React Best Practices such as folder and file structure, hooks, and refs
- Advanced State Management of the entire application using React Context API
- Next.js Best Practices such as file-based routing and data using server-side rendering and static generation
- Stripe to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process
- manage the entire content of your app using Sanity. Sanity is the unified content platform that’ll make the making of our entire app possible
- Deploy to ‘Vericel’ ‘cloud host

User Story and client's requirements:
Fully "interactive" e-commerce site--winsdar.com.
Client is able to manage with minimal tech skill.
Secure ‘financial’ transaction backed by ‘stripe’, ‘paypal’, or sim.
Provide ‘fully’ working site in 2 weeks.
Client wanted to ‘privatize’ their current ‘online’ business currently done through EBAY ‘store’.
Clients specialty was retailing ‘COSPLAY’ accessories, mainly ‘toy swords’ popularized by many Japanese anime shows.
Client wanted to focus on only few items and a simple site that they can manage easily without too much tech knowledge.
Site needs to be ‘scalable’ for the future.
We are available to continue development and management at client’s request.

Getting Started
npm sanity start

npm run dev
# or

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.js. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.js.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
